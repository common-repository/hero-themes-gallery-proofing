Heroic Gallery Proofing lets you and your clients review and rate photo galleries in a collaborative manner. 

== Description ==

Heroic Gallery Proofing add *protection* and *proofing* to your galleries.

Please note this plugin has been developed primarily for use with compatible themes, if your theme does not support Hero Gallery Proofing, results may vary.

If you are constantly passing photos via email, waiting for client feedback or just want a better way to present photography that allows multiple people to view, approve, rate and comment on a set of images, Heroic Gallery Proofing is the solution for you.

Integrating tightly with Heroic Gallery Manager, this plugin adds extra options that offer a wealth of additional functionality.

First and foremost, Heroic Gallery Proofing offers protection for your galleries. You can control who can access the galleries using a password, restricting to specific user accounts or even set a gallery opening and expiry date.

The proofing controls allow you to let users vote on images, add comments and submit the gallery as approved, with email notifications integrated. This reduces the client management and the approval process overhead. The result of this system is more time for you and more informed, satisfied clients.

Rather than the expense of hosted proofing systems, Heroic Gallery Proofing allows you to take complete control of your images and streamline your own proofing processes, right from your own WordPress powered website.
